# Simple CI/CD

The code housed in this repository was created for an [article](https://dev.to/cishiv/building-a-simple-ci-cd-pipeline-for-local-testing-using-go-docker-minikube-and-a-bash-script-1647) I wrote.

It contains a simple Go web app, and a build script, a k8s deployment descriptor and the command line automated build tool that the article describes the creation of.
